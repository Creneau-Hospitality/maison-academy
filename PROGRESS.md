# Progress

**Current phase:** 0, kick-off (nearly done).
**Last updated:** 16 October 2026.

## Done

- Week-1 decisions recorded in `DECISIONS.md`: sequence of service and timings, card approval, practice time, pilot dates and champion.
- Project folder set up at `5. OPERATIONS/maison-academy`.
- Content check done: `content/CONTENT_CHECK.md` lists what we have, 14 missing files with owners, and 5 points still to confirm.
- Accounts: GitHub organisation `Creneau-Hospitality` with private repository `maison-academy`; Supabase organisation `Creneau Hospitality` with project `maison-academy` in Frankfurt; Netlify team `Creneau Hospitality`. Gerard invited as owner on GitHub and Supabase.
- Repository set up with LICENSE, README credit, reports and exports folders.
- Hello page live at https://maison-academy.netlify.app (private for now), connected to Supabase in Frankfurt. Checked by David on 16 October.

## Next

1. Gerard accepts the GitHub and Supabase invitations and turns on Watch for the repository.
2. Publish the phase-0 release (report in `reports/`), so Gerard receives it.
3. Before Phase 1: allow package registries in Claude's network settings, and send the allergen matrix and current menus.

## Known issues

- No allergen matrix yet, so no allergen cards can be drafted.
- Netlify is on Free with one owner; move to Pro and add Gerard in Phase 4.
- Accounts use David's email for now. The shared Creneau mailbox must be added as owner on all three before Phase 4.
- Network: Claude's workspace can't reach the npm package registry, Supabase or Netlify (blocked by the session's network settings, checked 16 October). The Phase 0 hello page needs none of them. Phase 1 needs npm, so David (or the Claude plan's organisation owner) allows package registries, and ideally api.supabase.com and api.netlify.com, on claude.ai under Settings > Capabilities.
